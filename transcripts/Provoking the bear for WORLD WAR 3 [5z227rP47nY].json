{"text": " Hey good morning family praise the Lord thank you for joining me today well I have some good news to tell y'all are in our live prayer session yesterday and the one before I've done three videos over the last couple of days and over the course of the time Braden told me he said we've had on this channel alone we've had 1218 salvations I was just like wow the Lord said he was gonna he was bringing a stronger anointing for the unsaved to bring in the lost and he told us we're gonna start fishing with nets now you know and it's and it's happening it's exciting I just go Lord this is too cool look at what this channel this YouTube channel is doing all for the glory of God I just want to tell y'all thank you because it's people like you that come on here and pray with me and pray for the loss but you're clicking the like button you're clicking the subscribe you're clicking the notification bills you're commenting you're commenting something down below not all of you do but there's a there's at least 10 percent of you almost do and I just want to say thank you I know what some people don't like to comment but I just want to say those help you don't realize YouTube that's how the system works here and so when they they want to see who's interested in your videos they won't promote you and let new viewers see you unless they see that they're going to make ad revenue because every time you're watching the video if they're not making money on me to try to they go hey we're not promoting this guy so if they see the people are interested they'll let me be in a bigger pool of people to see the algorithm so it's exciting because you coming and staying around and clicking those bells they go hmm this this guy actually has them even if they don't like what I'm saying they it's really bottom line is it's about M-O-N-E-Y with with the people and and that's the world if it's not making money they don't promote it so I just want to say thank you thank you thank you thank you from the bottom of our hearts we want to say thank you and I know Jesus says thank you too because we're getting the say we're getting people saved 1218 this channel alone not all the other six we have South Korea Japan China all of them and and we give all the glory to Jesus Braden said I didn't even count the salvations on those channels dad so it probably is over 2000 with all those so I just wanted to say thank you all thank you it's exciting to be part of the end time harvest the Reapers we're the Reapers we're we're bringing in the lost one soul at a time but now it's not just one fish at a fishing pole we're doing it by the net loads and I just went golly lord I remember as a young man praying in those bathrooms and I was clean as a janitor saying God if you can use me use me if we can do if I can do something to help bring in the lost bring help me I'll do it I'll I'll I'll do whatever it takes and that's what it's been and that's why I was telling you all to go back to the awe of God John Bevere's book you some people because you've been in this so long you lose that passion the drive for for relationship with Jesus and it's all about relationship with Jesus if you follow Jesus and you do it with all your heart and you and you lean not onto your own understanding but in all thy ways you acknowledge him he said he directs your path he said he would and that's what exactly what he's doing me I don't want to come on YouTube but just think about all these people that got saved and I thought I would if we would have never have known who knows I pray somebody else would have reached him but the people that God's assigned you assigned you to help maybe you're the only one that they'll listen to maybe who knows but at that moment at this time God called us for such a time as this and so we're excited about the video yesterday the live stream was really I feel like it was successful with all of the turnout of people praying for the tsunamis because the Lord said if you pray I saw angel armies coming and standing on the the western seashore of California and we didn't have any major damage he said send them down to Hawaii and I don't think we had any major damage there or in Alaska or anything Japan I don't even think they had any real major damage from the tsunami but for as as large as this earthquake was it I believe it should have caused some major damage but it I mean I don't think it was but the Lord told me he said there will be things that you will not stop you need to have your boat ready you need to know what the spirit of the Lord's telling you for when these things come great shaking to awaken you're going to see it he talked about the earthquake last night again happened in the the water outside of by Portland he said pray over this area pray over Seattle pray over British Columbia for a major earthquake is about to take place and you must pray I saw 30 000 people perish during this now can we stop that in prayer I believe we could there's a lot of people we can pray that they'll not be in harm's way but I saw just in British Columbia alone 30 000 people die during that earthquake with buildings falling on them and stuff it was bad through the tsunamis and all the things this is what the Lord is warning us about the other part that the Lord warned us about last night if you remember he told us he said he said Brent I want you to go over that there'll be many people start to go home for judgment begins in the house of the Lord first and it's not just about the preacher behind the uh the stage that is messing around on his wife or husband or whatever is going on it's about the whole body for he said the enemy seed time harvest is accelerating this is what we talked about it's the seed time and harvest is accelerating Brandon well you warned me he said and what you sow you're going to reap as we see the time frame and the acceleration of things happen as the time frame is becoming shorter and shorter as the boat door as the days I know it so will it be when the son of man returns as we see the arc door closing it's like maybe going you can barely see it but you know that we're on the verge of something huge we're on the verge of something huge the raindrops are just starting to hit our foreheads I know it's not going to rain again this time and we're not going to have a major flood he said I won't judge you by water again but it will be by fire a major fire is going to judge the earth next time right so because that's what the Bible tells us but we are in that day as the days of Noah we're in it right now and there's many of you that are living in a compromising lifestyle and you're living in sin and you you've been a believer your whole life you feel like it's okay you know what I'm just a little lukewarm it's all right but the more you allow sin in the sin will keep you longer than you want to stay make you pay more than you want to pay remember Annette this lady named Annette used to tell me that all the time ready you better not be sinning boy you but it make you pay more than you want to pay it make you stay more than you want to stay she'd always tell me that I don't know the rest of I forget it but I remember it made me want to pay more than I want to pay I don't want to pay nobody nothing about it when it comes I told her okay God I don't want to pay the devil nothing that's what I was saying the devil he comes to kill still and destroy and so um so what I'm trying to tell you all is as the Lord keeps warning me to tell y'all Lot didn't know when a major event was about to happen it had to take Abraham interceding for him to send angels if if you're in Sodom and Gomorrah if you're in a place of compromise and you're not hearing God for yourself Lot didn't hear God for himself he had to have an intercessor pray for you pray for him and that's what this channel is here for you're here not by coincidence but for a purpose just like all the people who got born again in the last couple of days you're here for a purpose and I want you to to really examine your heart every single time you come on this platform though that's why the Lord brought up the all of God to me he said there's many people that have have lost their first their passion their first love go back to the basics of the abc's of where you fell in love with Jesus where you fell in love with becoming that fire of being on fire for Jesus and having a passion about being a Christian you want to tell everybody I got born again today why because it was something new to you because but as time goes the newness wears off sin tries to creep back in things get hard and you go man I don't know just get you know sometimes I pray sometimes I don't I may read my Bible every once in a while it I'll check into Brandon because I think he's kind of interesting that's what the Lord told me he said make prayer fun again Brandon for a lot of people have lost their way in prayer this is what your my channel is about it's to lead people back to to the foot of Jesus and tell them they've got what it takes to do it don't just the discouragement of life the bombardment of all of the trials and the tests and the hardships of things it makes you weary and well-doing but I'm telling you Jesus has some new win for your wings today he wants you to come unto him all ye that are heavy laden and he will give you rest Jesus wants to love on you today he's not mad at you he's there just like the prodigal son the father was waiting with his arms wide open with a robe and a great ready to kill the fatty calf and for the vegans that don't want to eat the fatty calf a good vegetable bowl but either way God has something good for you and I'm telling you it's time to know that Jesus has a plan for your life and it's not to it's not to harm you it's not to hurt you he's here to love on you you're here not by coincidence I've said that but because Jesus has a plan for your life and so I tell you all this because I have an urgency I have an urgency to tell you there's many people that are going to go start going home elders and not sold and you're going to go wire in the what happened with this Hollywood it's going to rain on the just and the unjust seed time and harvest accelerating on the just and the unjust it's not just about the church but but judgment begins in the house of the Lord first first but you're going to see it on the world too bad politicians corrupt Hollywood stars musicians playing you're going to see the unlikely you're going to go what in the world is going on who went home and it's not by a plague it's just by it'd be just like crazy stuff you know so I want you to get your heart right with the Lord and I don't try to scare you I try to prepare you I warned you about the war and this was a major topic of on our video last night of the Lord warning us about Zelensky and the provoking the bear the Lord said don't strong arm the bear President Trump be cautious of how you handle the bear with care handle the bear with care remember that and I saw an escalation of war and I saw key leaders in the EU wanting war war war an escalation because of money driving the economy and I saw Canada's prime minister involved in this and I saw the bear of oil trying to do oil trying to get a stability in the Canadian economy because the Canadian economy is bad in bad shape the Lord showed me and then I saw Mount Fuji explode and the Lord said it would be the equivalent of major atomic blast huge this was a massive destructive event and when this happened I saw Japan's economy crumble because of this natural disaster that's about to take place and it happened suddenly and it happened like like nobody was like I don't know if they were anticipating or not but most of the civilians worked and they were like walking around like every day and all of a sudden it was like somebody just set something off the snow cap was completely decimated that's how big this blast was it was like it would just leveled so I don't know what would cause that other than just a major eruption and a volcano but this was something that was of biblical proportions for what I saw coming to Japan now I saw it divided into two the island I saw major tsunami waves coming inland I saw major tsunami waves I saw a major mile wide volcano in the water outside of the of Oregon about to go off I saw all of the coastline of Alaska on fire from some kind of natural gas or something coming up out of the ground I don't know what happened I don't want to add to or take away from anything that I see but for some reason everything was on fire from British Columbia all the way up to Alaska the whole coastline was on fire now I don't understand why but it was very interesting because it went far in then the Lord warned us yesterday about major drought and very hot summer for Australia I know you're not in your summer months but the Lord told me you must pray for rain for I even saw kangaroos and cattle not having enough water places of of of ponds and and cisterns of water drying up it was I saw cracks upon the soil so big like huge cracks from the water vapor not being there anymore he showed me Sydney opera house and I know that I saw it was hot and you know whenever you see the waves of heat coming up from the ground I saw it all upon the land and so I pray for an outpouring of the of the spirit of of the Holy Ghost not only for the natural rain but for the because we're we see this weather manipulation remember I told you it'd be so dry and so drought in one place and there'll be great rains that are just flooding in another it will be so bad and so much drought and within a couple of 10 miles 100 miles it will be so much rain that they'll that they'll be the most colossal floods we've ever seen and I saw major snow storms snow storms to bury a house huge snow storms and it would happen within just like that and you have to dig your way out and people die because you're too cold and they can't get out of the houses because there's so much snow it happens so and suddenly downburst of snow coming so much so that like I said they'll have you won't be able to dig your way out it was incredible with the things I've seen and and hurricanes with and hurricane force wind like straight line winds that will exceed anything that's ever been on this earth before and he said as they try to control the weather they will lose control in the days ahead he warned us about this and he told me about a shaking in finances shakings in politics you're in all these things I I don't know I I try to recap a little bit for y'all but the main thing I saw and then I saw revival in Africa a major revival coming from Africa and I heard that I could hear them singing and I could hear the revival coming to Africa but I was more concerned even when I saw Australia not wanting to get involved with this war because it was trying to escalate out of control and I saw North Korea in the shadows and I saw Cuba and the Lord warned me about these two places North Korea Cuba he said watch Cuba I don't know how many times he's told us to watch Cuba and pray over about Cuba mules in the night darkness and I saw North Korea again and the Lord keeps warning us about it so I'm excited about where we are in these end times I really am I I talked to sister Billy she said in our prayer time she goes they have prayer on Wednesdays she's in our prayer time he said we're a minute away we're just right there Jesus is standing at the door there's things that are about to take place folks that we've never seen before but we're about to go home soon Jesus is coming soon and I have my eyes looking at him and I'm telling you I have an anticipation in my heart for major things to take place for the body of Christ so I just keep myself right and go back to the awe of God the Lord that's why the Lord said read John Bevere's book read that book the first four three four chapters of it and really try to get that down inside of you you may not have time to read all of it just read the first four chapters and really meditate on it and soul search check yourself and say God am I right before you is my heart right before you do I fear you do I have reverence for you is my is my wood wet am I on fire for you is my lamp full of oil today that's what I have to ask you all is your lamp full of oil today does Jesus know you you say I know a lot about Jesus but remember what he said you prophesied in my name you laid hands on the sick in my name you raised the dead you cast out nevels you did all these things but depart from me I never knew you that's a very scary place to be and a lot of people don't preach that they don't talk about it what was Jesus talking about you did all these things in my name but depart from me I never knew you was your lamp full of oil that day do you try to keep it full well how do I do that brother Brandon by seeking him by he said those that seek me will find me those that knock the door will be opened unto them seeking him reading the Bible praying fellowshiping with him singing songs making it said sing it be be instant end season out of season praying in the spirit lifting up holy hands with worship doing all that it takes to have a relationship with Jesus every single day father I know it's not about works it's about grace and he said in his word something you don't deserve and something you can earn grace is something that is very important it's it's it's the foundation of of salvation grace by grace you're saved through faith and so I want to encourage you you don't have to be perfect but we try to strive to be just like him every single day does that make sense what I'm saying we are all a work in progress but we're not trying to live like the world well you know I like going out and having parties and doing all these things and then you know and Jesus just did the graces there it didn't give you a free will to be a fool and sin well I'm gonna go to the strip club and look at the girls dancing on the pole and I'm gonna go out and have fun with my friends and we'll go out and do all this stuff and I and people get mad at me I get the emails oh I don't tell my teenagers my teachers watch you and they like going out to the clubs and having fun with their friends and I've been told off by them I said shame on you for saying that's okay for your kid well they have to have freedom I'm like okay I don't know how to tell you how stupid you really are I don't mean to be rude but I don't know how to tell you how stupid you really are you don't know when he's coming you don't know and is your lamp full five virgins had their lamp full and five didn't and as the bridegroom was coming they said oh my goodness we better go get our lamps full of oil but it was too late it's a day-to-day process you think well I'm gonna go film when I whenever I see him coming I hear the trumpet blowing I'm gonna start praying in tongues so I get my lamp full of oil all of a sudden you see everybody going up and you're they're getting taken in a blink of an eye they're going and you're going oh I gotta pray in tongues I get my lamp full of oil it's too late you waited too late is it worth it staying on fire he said I'd rather you be hot or cold but if you're lukewarm I'll spew you out of my mouth either you're all in or you're not either you're a believing believer or you're not but we're in the last of the last days ladies and gentlemen and as labor pains upon a woman so will it be as we step into August now August we are just 30 some days away from September and we're and the Lord told me September will be the month to remember for acceleration in the spirit realm an acceleration the spirit now what does that mean a September month to remember an acceleration of things from Rosh Hashanah to Rosh Hashanah he said get ready you're going to start to see things you never saw as labor pains you're going to see it it's the position of push no more labor pains the baby's here it's time push are you excited about it coming are you like you know because I hear some people say well the the rapture of the church the catching away of the church is not really convenient for people who want to have a marriage who want to go out and have a life it's the it's very invasive but I'm telling you there's nothing this world has to offer when you've seen the things I've seen about the glory and you see the other side like the portal that I saw with sister Lucy praying there is nothing on this earth that can compare to the glory of God and what we will feel on the other side we had just a little bitty but like a thimbleful maybe just even look maybe a little eraser head cap full of something we do on this channel and we experience a little bit of something and we drink from that little thimble thing oh that was some good glory look he's my cup runneth over he didn't say my thimbleful but my come up your cup will runneth over you understand it's time for a I want a 50 gallon barrel full of the holy ghost and fire and I'm going to try to just take it and dump it on me I want to be in the splash zone that's what I'm talking about being a Shamu and being at the sea world and you see that big Shamu go out there and everybody want to sit way up at the back because they don't want to get wet by Shamu and he he he sometimes he's up there and he just goes in that water and they're on those people and if they have their hair all messed up they got a wig on or something their hair's dripping off and they got they're trying to fix themselves and they got their makeups running down their face and they're going oh my gosh what just happened I want to get messy do you get it you understand I said kind of I I want to get wasted in Jesus let's have fun that's why he said make prayer fun again for these young people Brandon they're so used to religion nothing I ever do I hope on this channel is religion ever it's all about relationship now I get a lot of hate from a lot of big other people and I and one of the prophetic guys I've talked to like I said I don't like to name names drop names you know like drop your name card y'all everybody's like oh look who I talked to yeah I ain't getting all that celebrity crap listen I talked to one though it was really fun conversation and I said you know I don't get a lot of big big name people like that say hey we want to talk to them I got a lot of the a lot of the sheep they love you but the bigger people they don't they kind of hold me at an arm's length and he said Brandon because what the Lord showed me he said because you see their mess and they don't want you calling them out on it and he said they hold you that way because you have great discernment and you walk in a very strong anointing Brandon and he goes and there's a lot of people walking in a lot of compromise these days I said that that that made me feel good but not too much you know you know wow that's that's terrible but at the same time my job is never to embarrass anybody about what I see because I see some stuff and 99 percent of the time I don't say nothing to nobody about what I see on them I don't if the Lord reveals it to me he's he it's a gift it flows it's a cloak I feel it come on me but he has an opinion about everybody what does God say about you to other people who walk with a gifting is your lamp full presence has an atmosphere you carry a presence and when you're filled with the Holy Ghost you know when that presence when you come in contact with somebody else with presence you know when they have presence you know when they have something going on with maybe it's with alcohol addiction or or pornography or angry issues or depression issues or something you just know because it's a presence and the presence of their overflow you can feel it does that make sense what's in you an overflow I want so much so that the overflow of me is his prayer fragrance and when I walk in a room people know and especially if they have a gift and I told because you're your fool will fight it's like brother Billy Burke always told me Sabrina your fool will fight for you your fool will fight for you what is your fool saying what's coming out of you and your greatest level of fullness what do people see about you what did they discern about you and that's why I thought it was interesting when I talked to that other person they said you don't even realize because you become so accustomed to what you walk in I but I'm telling you all it's not about me I'm gonna always say this it's not about me but I want you to check yourself not for me but for him what did what does the Holy Spirit say about you to fill yourself up so that you don't think you're hiding something search me and know me just like David said search me and know me change me God give give me a pure heart cleanse me make me have a pure heart before you but I'm saying what does it say about your heart whenever whenever if it's what is it what's an abundance in your heart because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speak but not so much it's what I'm trying to say is is out of the the overflow of who you are the atmosphere speaks does it make sense it's what it's what what you carry it's what you carry are you a person full of strife are you a person full of gossip are you a person full of just of insecurity there's things I work on every day y'all I'm not saying I'm perfect but I try to work on these things because I want to make sure I'm going from glory to glory I don't always want to come on here and pray and make keep you all afternoon you know the last two videos it was like two hours and two hours and everything else so I know you have other things to do other than watch Brandon on the internet but I just wanted to come on and do a little bit of a recap for you kind of talk about some things and and tell you I'm excited about what Jesus is doing and just tell you we love you and give you some encouragement today to keep that awe of God that refreshing inside of you to go back to the abc's reading books and stirring yourself up that you don't let your wood get wet and and let the fire go out we've got to keep the gasoline and the the kindling and the logs on our fire in these last days because it because the world will try to put it out he comes they come by up there big old 50 gallon bucket of water trying to put our it goes fire out but this little light of mine I'm gonna let you I'm so candle I want an inferno but you go little candle this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine and you're looking around and you're going I'm gonna let it shine I don't want that I want to be great big holy ghosts and fire that they go ouch we can't get too close to it because we're gonna send ourselves like that Shadrach Meshach and Abednego when the soldier tried to throw them in there they all went in there and they got burnt up but guess who didn't Shadrach Meshach and Abednego but who was the fourth man you know what I'm saying that's what I'm talking about who's the fourth man he's with Brandon with all those soldiers the people the fire burn them up because they heat the furnace even hotter but what happens when the fire around us gets hotter and the water and people try to put out your fire and all these things we see all this stuff I just I just want to be on fire for Jesus be instant end season and out of season no I'm sorry brother I was out please can you pray for me I know you go to my church I just my my family member just died there in the hospital and I got the other one would you please will you pray for him I just went out to the bar and I just drank you know all this and I'm a little tipsy right now let me sober up and we'll go pray for your your family member no you know I'm sorry I just went and been looking at porn all afternoon I don't have time to to go and pray for your family I you know I don't even know God will hear me if I did right now because I've been looking at dirty stuff all day seriously do you get what I'm trying to tell y'all evaluating yourself don't allow the devil to have one inch in your life because somebody's gonna need you sometime I've got myself full of fire are you ready let's go you hey Brandon my mom is in the whoever can you come and pray can you can you yes we're laying here we're interceding we're breaking out of tongues we're taking communion but I know that even in my best day my righteousness is a filthy rags even what I told you about my dog getting raised I have to go back to that but there's a point was is I wasn't practicing sin then I just lost it at that time does that make sense I wasn't I was going to say well Diana let's go to the club no I had a flesh fart I freaked out for that moment but I don't practice that and don't live that way does that make sense I don't make this a habit to freak out and flesh out and go the guy cut me off on the road I practice temperance and patience and kindness and goodness that's what I I tried but it you know sometimes you mess up I have to say that there's a big difference between when you you deliberately be stupid and be and whatever you know sometimes we just have a bad day you know but God's grace is sufficient for all of it and we just turn back and say God forgive us does it make sense but I want to be that person that's that's filled with control by the Holy Ghost in these last days that they say if I need to call him he's going to be ready to pray and that's what I prayed for you all today did this bless you I hope it did I I want to encourage you to stir you up so father I just thank you Lord for every single person who's here today that comes support this channel on a regular basis father we lift them up before you we thank you Lord that you're fanning the flame that's inside of them the father not only is it just with some kindling but father you're putting some Holy Ghost gasoline on that person and father there is a fire that's raging on and it's not a flash in a pan it burns hot we got some we got some some paper we got all kinds of wood on there and that fire is going to be a major fire burning on the inside of them in these last days I thank you father that you've called them women and children men old doesn't matter it's all hands on deck you've called them for such a time as this and father I thank you Lord for every single person that's watching this video right now father we call them stirred up from the top of their head to the soles of their feet that they're drinking out of that living water they're eating that spiritual food and they are becoming spiritual giants in the land father that they're not looking down and going well you know what I don't know sometimes God does and sometimes he doesn't know we're believing that God is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him and that father that we can have whatever things we desire when we pray we believe that we receive them and we shall have them and if we knock the door will be open unto us he's not going sometimes I do sometimes I don't he's a God that is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him and father I thank you Lord for you are our rewarder you're our ever present help at a time of need you said in your word father that we can ask anything anything nothing's too big and nothing's too small Jesus paid the price for it all and I believe father for healing and demonstrations and manifestations of the glory will will be on these people's lives as they go into this weekend as they go into the weeks ahead father that this will be a time like they've never seen before of a financial breakthrough of marriage breakthrough of their children wayward coming home wives daughters sons what that doesn't matter Jesus I thank you Lord that you're touching them at the point of their need whatever they need today God I believe that I believe with them I be there too I'm agreeing and touching with them that this is coming to pass and that the expiration date of what they're believing for is coming today in Jesus name I thank you that you are the God of the breakthrough and that you are LL yawn the most high God Jehovah Jireh you will provide all I need in Jesus name and I call their finances blessed in the city in the field coming in and going out that this will be a time like they've never seen before of great acceleration of spiritual growth of financial blessing and of healing and demonstrations of the glory in their life father I thank you Lord that they're not bound by any addictions they're not bound by any pain father I thank you Lord that you've come to set the captives free and for whom the son has set free is free indeed and everybody say amen and amen are you free today say amen I believe it for whom the son has set free is free indeed and that's you today I believe you're free and there's an expiration date to your problems it's time to believe for what was impossible to be now become possible in your life do you believe it God's a God that is overflow and he's a little like like maybe this like this little cup I don't know well God no God's a big bottle God he is it's stacking up no there you go God's a big bottle God big big bottle I got a bunch of these now we got a big bottle of water it's not no little we got we got we got cases of it but I'm saying look at what God is doing he's not just a little thimble fool he's an overflow God and I'm telling you it's time to believe in for overflow God bless you all today thank you for I hope this encourages you today I truly do because we love you and we want you to know that Jesus loves you and he wants he has a plan for your life he does it's to prosper and to have
